Iâ€™m convinced his brain never stops working as he always seems one step ahead in class and always has an idea or suggestion to solve a problem, be it with JavaScript or React. He seems to always challenge himself by trying to tackle some of the hardest parts [of a project] to make sure that they work perfectly. I can confidently say that our project would not have gone as smoothly as it did without his curiosity and talent.",
